# Session G1: smartterm-prototype Repository Improvement

## Your Assignment

**Repository**: smartterm-prototype (C terminal UI library proof-of-concept)
**Session ID**: session-G1
**Phase**: 2 - Repository Improvements
**Estimated Duration**: 3-4 hours
**Complexity**: Low

## Context

You are working on the jcaldwell-labs organization improvement project. This is one of 9 parallel sessions improving all repositories simultaneously. Your focus is the smartterm-prototype repository - a terminal UI library proof-of-concept that may be used by other projects.

## Getting Started

1. **First Actions**:
   - You are already in the smartterm-prototype repository
   - Read the coordination roadmap: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs/master/ROADMAP-2025.md
   - Read the parallel session guide: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs/master/PARALLEL-SESSION-GUIDE.md
   - Understand the Phase 2 objectives

2. **Claim Your Repository**:
   - Clone the coordination repo: `git clone https://github.com/jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs.git ~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination`
   - Update `~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination/PARALLEL-SESSION-MANIFEST.md`
   - Change smartterm-prototype status from "not_started" to "in_progress"
   - Add your session ID (session-G1) and start date
   - Commit and push from coordination repo:
     ```bash
     cd ~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination
     git add PARALLEL-SESSION-MANIFEST.md
     git commit -m "Session G1: Claiming smartterm-prototype"
     git push
     ```

3. **Start Context Tracking**:
   ```bash
   export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:smartterm_improvement
   my-context start "phase2-improvement-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   my-context note "Starting Phase 2 improvements for smartterm-prototype"
   my-context note "Session ID: session-G1"
   ```

## Your Tasks

### Standard Checklist

- [ ] Add or improve code comments for API functions
- [ ] Compile with `-Wall -Wextra` and fix warnings
- [ ] Review TODO/FIXME comments
- [ ] Review for security issues
- [ ] Remove dead code

#### Testing
- [ ] Verify test suite exists (create if missing)
- [ ] Add tests for terminal UI functions
- [ ] Run all tests and fix failures
- [ ] Document test coverage
- [ ] Document how to run tests

#### Build System
- [ ] Verify Makefile with proper targets
- [ ] Add/verify targets: build, test, clean, install
- [ ] Document build dependencies
- [ ] Test build on clean checkout

#### CI/CD
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/c.yml)
- [ ] Ensure CI runs tests on PR
- [ ] Add build verification to CI
- [ ] Add CI status badge to README

#### Project Health
- [ ] Review open issues and close stale ones
- [ ] Add issue templates
- [ ] Add PR template
- [ ] Review description and topics (terminal, ui, library, ncurses)
- [ ] Verify license
- [ ] Add CHANGELOG.md

### Repository-Specific Tasks

- [ ] **Extract reusable terminal UI library**
  - Identify reusable components
  - Create clean API surface
  - Document public vs private functions
  - Consider creating smartterm.h header file

- [ ] **Document API**
  - Document all public functions
  - Add usage examples
  - Document initialization/cleanup sequences
  - Add API reference documentation

- [ ] **Add example applications**
  - Create examples/ directory
  - Add simple example programs demonstrating the library
  - Document each example
  - Make examples easy to build and run

- [ ] **Consider graduating from "prototype" status**
  - Evaluate if library is ready for production use
  - If yes, rename/rebrand repository
  - If no, document what's needed for production readiness
  - Update repository description accordingly

## Deliverables

1. **Pull Request** with all improvements
   - Branch name: `improve/phase2-improvements`
   - Title: "Phase 2: Repository improvements for smartterm-prototype"
   - Description: Link to improvement report, summarize changes

2. **Improvement Report** (`reports/SMARTTERM-PROTOTYPE-IMPROVEMENT-REPORT.md` in coordination repo)
   - Use template from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs/master/templates/IMPROVEMENT-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md
   - Save to: `~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination/reports/SMARTTERM-PROTOTYPE-IMPROVEMENT-REPORT.md`
   - Document all checklist items completed
   - Note any items marked as "future work"
   - Include metrics (before/after)
   - List all files modified/added

3. **Manifest Update** (in coordination repo)
   - Update `~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination/PARALLEL-SESSION-MANIFEST.md`
   - Set status to "completed"
   - Add completion date, PR link, report link

4. **Context Export**
   - Export my-context session to `~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination/sessions/session-G1-smartterm-prototype.md`

## Quality Gates

Before marking complete, verify:

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Build succeeds with `-Wall -Wextra`
- [ ] No memory leaks (check with valgrind if applicable)
- [ ] No compiler warnings
- [ ] API documented
- [ ] Examples added and working
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR created and ready for review
- [ ] Improvement report written
- [ ] Manifest updated

## Time Management

- **Time Budget**: 3-4 hours
- **Time-Boxing**: If an item takes too long, document it for future work and move on
- **Don't let one item block completion** - note blockers in the report

## Common C Library Checks

- Check for buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- Verify all memory allocations have corresponding frees
- Check for null pointer dereferences
- Verify error handling for system calls
- Check ncurses initialization/cleanup if used
- Document thread-safety properties
- Check for memory leaks in library code

## Important Notes

- **Work independently** - other sessions work on other repos
- **Document blockers** in the improvement report
- **Create issues** for work that can't be completed in time budget
- **Focus on quality, documentation, and testing** - not extensive new features
- **Commit frequently** with clear commit messages
- **Make the library usable** - good API docs and examples are key

## Communication

- **Updates**: Via PARALLEL-SESSION-MANIFEST.md
- **Blockers**: Note in manifest and improvement report
- **Completion**: Update manifest, create PR, write report
- **Questions**: Create issue in jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs repo

## Workflow Summary

```
1. Claim repository (update manifest) ✓

```

## Ready to Start?

Confirm you understand:
1. Your assignment (smartterm-prototype repository - terminal UI library)
2. The standard checklist
3. The smartterm-specific tasks (extract library, document API, add examples, evaluate status)
4. Your deliverables (PR, report, manifest update, context export)
5. The quality gates (tests pass, API documented, examples working)

Once confirmed, begin by claiming the repository in the manifest.

Good luck! 🚀
