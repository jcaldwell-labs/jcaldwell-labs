You are working on Phase 3c of the jcaldwell-labs organization improvement project.

CONTEXT:
- Organization: jcaldwell-labs (9 terminal-based open source projects)
- Phase 2: Complete (8/9 repos improved)
- Phase 3a: Complete (unified build system)
- Phase 3b: Complete (integration examples)
- Current Phase: Phase 3c - Organization Infrastructure
- Your Role: Standardize organization-wide settings and templates

PHASE 2 LESSONS:
1. Small PRs merge faster: 3 focused PRs instead of comprehensive changes
2. Test carefully: Org changes affect ALL repos
3. Incremental: One category at a time (settings, then standardization, then templates)

PROTOCOLS (MUST READ):
All in jcaldwell-labs coordination repo:
1. docs/PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md
2. docs/ESCALATION-PROTOCOL.md
3. docs/INCREMENTAL-MERGE-STRATEGY.md
4. docs/DONE-DEFINITION.md

YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
Audit and standardize GitHub organization infrastructure across all 9 repositories.

TASK BREAKDOWN (from ROADMAP-2025.md Phase 3c):

PR 1: Organization settings audit (~200 lines)
  - Create: docs/ORG-SETTINGS-AUDIT.md
  - Audit: GitHub org settings, permissions, security settings
  - Document: Current state, recommended changes, rationale
  - Apply: Standardize settings across organization
  - Success: Settings documented and applied
  - Time: ~6h base + buffers = 12h

PR 2: Repository standardization (~150 lines)
  - Review: All 9 repo topics, labels, descriptions
  - Standardize: Common labels across repos, consistent topics
  - Update: Each repo's GitHub settings via gh CLI or web
  - Document: Standard label set, topic guidelines
  - Success: All repos have consistent metadata
  - Depends on: PR 1 merged
  - Time: ~5h base + buffers = 10h

PR 3: Organization-wide templates (~200 lines)
  - Create/Update: .github repo templates (issue, PR, discussions)
  - Files: .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/, .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/
  - Ensure: Available for all repos in organization
  - Success: Templates work for new issues/PRs in any repo
  - Depends on: PR 2 provides context
  - Time: ~6h base + buffers = 12h

TOTAL: 3 PRs, ~550 lines, ~34h estimated

CRITICAL NOTES:

1. **Organization-wide impact**: Changes affect all 9 repos
2. **Test carefully**: Verify changes don't break existing workflows
3. **Document rationale**: Explain WHY each standardization choice
4. **Backwards compatible**: Don't break existing issues/PRs/workflows
5. **Coordinate with owner**: Org settings may need approval

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

For EACH PR:
1. RESEARCH: Understand current state across all 9 repos
2. DOCUMENT: Propose changes in markdown doc first
3. REVIEW: Get approval for proposed changes (especially org settings)
4. IMPLEMENT: Apply changes carefully
5. VALIDATE: Test that changes work as expected
6. CREATE PR: In appropriate repo (jcaldwell-labs for docs, .github for templates)
7. MONITOR: Verify no negative impacts
8. MERGE: After approval
9. DELETE BRANCH: Clean up

CRITICAL RULES:

1. AUDIT FIRST: Don't change without understanding current state
2. DOCUMENT CHANGES: Every change must have rationale
3. TEST IMPACT: Verify changes work across multiple repos
4. SEQUENTIAL ONLY: PR 2 after PR 1 merged, PR 3 after PR 2 merged
5. GET APPROVAL: Org-level changes may need owner sign-off
6. ROLLBACK PLAN: Document how to undo changes if needed
7. TIME-BOX: 40h total budget (34h base + 6h buffer)

ORGANIZATION SETTINGS TO AUDIT:

- Member permissions
- Repository creation rules
- Default repository settings
- Security settings (dependabot, code scanning, secret scanning)
- Actions permissions
- Package permissions
- Discussion settings
- Project settings
- Team structures

REPOSITORY STANDARDIZATION:

Common labels to add across repos:
- `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`
- `good first issue`, `help wanted`
- `priority: high/medium/low`
- `status: blocked/in-progress`

Common topics to add:
- `terminal`, `cli`, `c`, `go`, `python` (language-specific)
- Project-specific topics

"DONE DONE" CRITERIA:

✓ All 3 PRs merged
✓ Organization settings audited and standardized
✓ All 9 repos have consistent labels/topics
✓ Templates available organization-wide
✓ Changes tested and verified working
✓ Improvement report with audit findings
✓ my-context session exported

SUCCESS METRICS:

- 3 PRs created and merged
- Organization settings audit complete
- All repos standardized
- Templates work correctly
- No broken workflows from changes

START HERE:

1. Clone jcaldwell-labs coordination repo
2. Read docs/PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md
3. Set up my-context:
   export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:jcaldwell_labs
   my-context start "phase3c-org-infrastructure-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
4. Start audit (PR 1): Review org settings, document findings
5. Use gh CLI for GitHub API interactions

CAUTION:

Organization-wide changes can have unexpected impacts. Be conservative. Test thoroughly. Document everything. Get approval for major changes.

Your goal: Consistent, professional organization infrastructure that scales.
