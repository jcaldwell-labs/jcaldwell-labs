You are working on Phase 3d Session 2 of the jcaldwell-labs organization improvement project.

CONTEXT:
- Organization: jcaldwell-labs (9 terminal-based open source projects)
- Phase 2: Complete (8/9 repos improved)
- Phase 3a: Complete (unified build system)
- Phase 3b: Complete (integration examples)
- Current Phase: Phase 3d Session 2 - Project Comparison + Contributor Guide
- Your Role: Create project comparison matrix and comprehensive contributor guide

PHASE 2 LESSONS:
1. Incremental PRs: 2 focused PRs instead of comprehensive docs
2. Test documentation: Validate guides are complete and accurate
3. Make it actionable: Readers should know exactly what to do next

PROTOCOLS (MUST READ):
All in jcaldwell-labs coordination repo:
1. docs/PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md
2. docs/DONE-DEFINITION.md
3. docs/INCREMENTAL-MERGE-STRATEGY.md

YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
Create project comparison matrix and expanded contributor guide for jcaldwell-labs organization.

TASK BREAKDOWN (from ROADMAP-2025.md Phase 3d Session 2):

PR 1: Project comparison matrix (~300 lines)
  - Create: docs/PROJECT-COMPARISON.md
  - Content:
    * All 9 projects compared side-by-side
    * Categories: Language, Status, Complexity, Use Case, Dependencies
    * Features: What each project does uniquely
    * Maturity: Production vs Active Dev vs Prototype
    * Contribution opportunities: Where help is needed
    * Table format for easy scanning
  - Success: Clear comparison helps users choose project
  - Time: ~8h base + buffers = 16h

PR 2: Comprehensive contributor guide (~400 lines)
  - Create: docs/CONTRIBUTOR-GUIDE.md
  - Content:
    * How to contribute (beyond basic getting started)
    * Code review process
    * Testing standards by language
    * Documentation standards
    * Commit message conventions
    * PR best practices
    * Release process
    * Community guidelines
    * Communication channels
  - Success: Contributors know expectations and processes
  - Depends on: PR 1 provides project context
  - Time: ~8h base + buffers = 16h

TOTAL: 2 PRs, ~700 lines, ~32h estimated

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

FOR PROJECT COMPARISON:
1. **Objective assessment**: Rate each project honestly
2. **Consistent criteria**: Use same comparison dimensions for all
3. **Help users choose**: Make it obvious which project fits their interests
4. **Contribution signals**: Show where help is most needed
5. **Keep updated**: Design for easy maintenance

COMPARISON TABLE FORMAT:
```markdown
| Project | Language | Status | Use Case | Complexity | Contrib Opportunity |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| boxes-live | C | Active | Terminal canvas (Miro alt) | High | Protocol development |
| my-context | Go | Production | Context tracking | Medium | Feature requests |
[etc. for all 9 projects]
```

FOR CONTRIBUTOR GUIDE:
1. **Expand on GETTING-STARTED**: Assume reader followed that first
2. **Deeper process details**: What happens after first PR?
3. **Quality standards**: What makes a good contribution?
4. **Language-specific**: C conventions vs Go conventions
5. **Review process**: What to expect when PR is reviewed
6. **Community**: How to communicate, ask questions

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

For EACH PR:
1. RESEARCH: Review all 9 project READMEs, CONTRIBUTING.md files
2. DRAFT: Write documentation
3. CROSS-CHECK: Ensure consistency with existing docs
4. VALIDATE: Ask "Is this complete? Actionable? Clear?"
5. CREATE PR: In jcaldwell-labs repo
6. REQUEST REVIEW: Get feedback
7. REVISE: Address feedback
8. MERGE: After approval
9. DELETE BRANCH: Clean up

CRITICAL RULES:

1. COMPREHENSIVE: Cover all important topics
2. ACCURATE: Verify all information is current
3. ACTIONABLE: Readers know what to do
4. CONSISTENT: Align with existing documentation
5. SEQUENTIAL: PR 2 after PR 1 merged
6. TIME-BOX: 38h total budget (32h base + 6h buffer)

CROSS-REFERENCES:

Your docs should reference:
- GETTING-STARTED.md (from Phase 3d Session 1)
- Workflow examples (from Phase 3b Session 3)
- Individual project CONTRIBUTING.md files
- BUILD-SYSTEM.md (from Phase 3a)

"DONE DONE" CRITERIA:

✓ Both docs written and complete
✓ Both PRs merged
✓ Project comparison matrix accurate
✓ Contributor guide comprehensive
✓ Cross-references correct
✓ Improvement report written
✓ my-context session exported

SUCCESS METRICS:

- 2 PRs created and merged
- Comparison matrix helps users choose projects
- Contributor guide answers common questions
- Documentation professional and complete

START HERE:

1. Clone jcaldwell-labs coordination repo
2. Read existing organization docs for context
3. Set up my-context:
   export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:jcaldwell_labs
   my-context start "phase3d-session2-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
4. Review all 9 project repos (understand each thoroughly)
5. Start with PR 1 (comparison matrix)

COORDINATION:

You are Session 2 of 2 parallel Phase 3d sessions:
- Session 1: Getting started + showcase (can reference their work)
- Session 2 (you): Comparison + contributor guide (independent)

Minimal dependencies. Both sessions can run simultaneously.

QUALITY STANDARDS:

- Comparison must be fair and objective
- Guide must be comprehensive (answer common questions)
- Writing must be clear and professional
- Information must be current and accurate
- Links must all work

REMEMBER:
These docs represent the organization to the world. Make them excellent.

Your success: Clear comparison + comprehensive guide = easier contribution path.
