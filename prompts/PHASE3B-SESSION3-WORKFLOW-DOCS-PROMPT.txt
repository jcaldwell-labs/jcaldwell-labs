You are working on Phase 3b Session 3 of the jcaldwell-labs organization improvement project.

CONTEXT:
- Organization: jcaldwell-labs (9 terminal-based open source projects)
- Phase 2: Complete (8/9 repos improved)
- Phase 3a: Complete (unified build system)
- Current Phase: Phase 3b Session 3 - Example Workflow Documentation
- Your Role: Create executable workflow examples showing tool integration

PHASE 2 LESSONS:
1. Small focused PRs (not comprehensive docs)
2. Examples must be EXECUTABLE (copy/paste works)
3. Pre-PR validation catches issues early
4. Documentation is code - must be tested

PROTOCOLS (MUST READ):
All in jcaldwell-labs coordination repo:
1. docs/PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md
2. scripts/pre-pr-check.sh (for code, not docs, but useful mindset)
3. docs/ESCALATION-PROTOCOL.md
4. docs/DONE-DEFINITION.md

YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
Create 2 complete workflow examples demonstrating multi-tool integration patterns.

TASK BREAKDOWN (from ROADMAP-2025.md Phase 3b Session 3):

PR 1: Complete development workflow guide (~300 lines)
  - Create: docs/workflows/COMPLETE-DEV-WORKFLOW.md
  - Content: Step-by-step workflow using build system + my-context + git
  - Includes: Starting work, building, testing, tracking with my-context, creating PR
  - Format: Executable markdown (all commands copy-pasteable)
  - Success: Following the guide produces working result
  - Time: ~6h base + buffers = 12h

PR 2: boxes-live + my-context workflow example (~250 lines)
  - Create: docs/workflows/BOXES-LIVE-SESSION-EXAMPLE.md
  - Content: Complete session using boxes-live with context tracking
  - Includes: Setup, running boxes-live, using connectors, my-context tracking
  - Format: Executable markdown with expected outputs
  - Success: Example is complete, copy-paste works
  - Depends on: PR 1 provides template/pattern
  - Time: ~6h base + buffers = 12h

TOTAL: 2 PRs, ~550 lines, ~24h estimated

WORKFLOW MUST BE EXECUTABLE:

Each workflow doc MUST include:
- Complete command sequences (no placeholders like [YOUR_NAME])
- Expected outputs (show what success looks like)
- Troubleshooting section (common issues and fixes)
- Prerequisites clearly listed
- Success criteria (how to know it worked)

EXAMPLE FORMAT:
```markdown
## Workflow: [Name]

### Prerequisites
- [Tool 1] installed
- [Tool 2] configured
- [Environment variable] set

### Step 1: [Action]
```bash
# Command with explanation
$ command-here --with-flags

# Expected output:
[show expected output]
```

### Step 2: [Next Action]
[Continue pattern]

### Success Criteria
✓ [Outcome 1]
✓ [Outcome 2]

### Troubleshooting
Issue: [Common problem]
Solution: [How to fix]
```

CRITICAL RULES:

1. TEST EVERYTHING: Every command must be tested by you
2. NO PLACEHOLDERS: Use real examples (redact secrets only)
3. SHOW OUTPUTS: Include expected outputs for commands
4. ONE PR AT A TIME: PR 2 only after PR 1 merged
5. VALIDATE COMPLETENESS: Can someone follow this blind?
6. TIME-BOX: 30h total budget (24h base + 6h buffer)

"DONE DONE" CRITERIA:

✓ Both workflow docs created
✓ Both PRs merged
✓ All commands tested and working
✓ Outputs verified accurate
✓ Troubleshooting sections complete
✓ Improvement report written
✓ my-context session exported

SUCCESS METRICS:

- 2 PRs created and merged
- Workflows are executable (tested)
- Examples demonstrate tool integration
- New user can follow and succeed
- Troubleshooting covers common issues

START HERE:

1. Clone jcaldwell-labs coordination repo
2. Read protocol docs (esp PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md)
3. Set up my-context:
   export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:jcaldwell_labs
   my-context start "phase3b-session3-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
4. Review existing docs for style guide
5. Start with PR 1 (complete dev workflow)

COORDINATION:

You are Session 3 of 3 parallel Phase 3b sessions:
- Session 1: my-context integration (independent)
- Session 2: Terminal UI extraction (independent)
- Session 3 (you): Workflow documentation (independent)

Work independently. Reference Session 1's work if helpful for examples.

QUALITY STANDARDS:

- Commands must be copy-pasteable
- Outputs must be accurate
- Troubleshooting must be helpful
- Examples must work end-to-end
- Documentation is tested, not assumed

REMEMBER:
Good documentation is tested documentation. Run every command. Verify every output.

Your success: Can a new contributor follow your workflows and succeed?
