You are working on Phase 3b Session 1 of the jcaldwell-labs organization improvement project.

CONTEXT:
- Organization: jcaldwell-labs (9 terminal-based open source projects)
- Phase 2: Complete (8/9 repos improved)
- Phase 3a: Complete (unified build system exists)
- Current Phase: Phase 3b Session 1 - my-context Integration Example
- Your Role: Demonstrate how projects integrate with my-context tool

PHASE 2 LESSONS APPLIED:
1. Incremental PRs (4 small PRs, not 1 large PR)
2. Pre-PR validation mandatory
3. Fix in place (not new PRs for fixes)
4. "Done done" enforcement (CI passing, not just created)

PROTOCOLS (MUST READ):
All in jcaldwell-labs coordination repo:
1. docs/PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md
2. scripts/pre-pr-check.sh
3. docs/ESCALATION-PROTOCOL.md
4. docs/INCREMENTAL-MERGE-STRATEGY.md
5. docs/DONE-DEFINITION.md

YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
Create my-context integration with fintrack as reference implementation, demonstrating pattern for other projects.

TASK BREAKDOWN (from ROADMAP-2025.md Phase 3b Session 1):

PR 1: Design document (~100 lines)
  - Create: docs/MY-CONTEXT-INTEGRATION-PATTERN.md
  - Content: How projects integrate with my-context
  - Success: Pattern documented and reviewed
  - Time: ~3h base + buffers = 6h

PR 2: fintrack integration code (~200 lines)
  - Files: fintrack/internal/context/, command updates
  - Features: fintrack can start/stop my-context sessions
  - Success: Integration works, tests locally
  - Depends on: PR 1 merged
  - Time: ~6h base + buffers = 12h

PR 3: fintrack integration tests (~150 lines)
  - Files: fintrack/tests/integration/context_test.go
  - Tests: Session start, stop, note, export
  - Success: Integration tests passing
  - Depends on: PR 2 merged
  - Time: ~4h base + buffers = 8h

PR 4: fintrack integration documentation (~200 lines)
  - Files: fintrack/docs/MY-CONTEXT-INTEGRATION.md, README updates
  - Content: User guide, examples, troubleshooting
  - Success: Users can follow guide
  - Depends on: PR 2, 3 merged
  - Time: ~4h base + buffers = 8h

TOTAL: 4 PRs, ~650 lines, ~34h estimated

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

For EACH PR:
1. PLAN: Review task requirements
2. IMPLEMENT: Write code for this PR only
3. VALIDATE LOCALLY: Run pre-pr-check.sh in fintrack repo (MUST PASS)
4. CREATE PR: Only after local validation passes
5. MONITOR CI: Wait for green checkmarks
6. IF CI FAILS: Follow PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL decision tree
7. MERGE: After approval
8. DELETE BRANCH: Clean up immediately
9. NEXT PR: Move to next in sequence

CRITICAL RULES:

1. ONE PR AT A TIME: PR 2 only after PR 1 merged
2. SINGLE REPO FOCUS: All work in fintrack repo
3. NO SCOPE CREEP: Only integrate my-context, nothing else
4. INCREMENTAL: Each PR independently valuable
5. LOCAL VALIDATION: pre-pr-check.sh BEFORE every PR
6. FIX IN PLACE: Don't create new PRs to fix old ones
7. TIME-BOX: Total budget 40h (34h base + 6h buffer)

WHAT "DONE DONE" MEANS:

NOT done until:
✓ All 4 PRs merged (not just created)
✓ CI passing on all PRs
✓ Integration works end-to-end
✓ Documentation complete and tested
✓ Improvement report written
✓ my-context session exported
✓ Manifest updated: "completed"

SUCCESS METRICS:

- 4 PRs created and merged
- Zero PR closures
- < 2 fix iterations per PR
- fintrack can start my-context sessions
- Integration pattern documented
- Other projects can follow pattern

START HERE:

1. Clone jcaldwell-labs coordination repo
2. Read PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md (critical!)
3. Read INCREMENTAL-MERGE-STRATEGY.md
4. Set up my-context:
   export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:jcaldwell_labs
   my-context start "phase3b-session1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
5. Clone/enter fintrack repo
6. Start with PR 1 (design document)

COORDINATION:

You are Session 1 of 3 parallel Phase 3b sessions:
- Session 1 (you): my-context integration
- Session 2: Terminal UI component extraction
- Session 3: Example workflow documentation

Sessions run independently. Coordinate via manifest only.

REMEMBER:
Phase 2 taught us: Large PRs fail more often. Small incremental PRs merge faster and more reliably.

Your goal: Demonstrate my-context integration so well that other projects can follow your pattern.

Quality > speed. Follow protocols strictly.
