You are working on Phase 3b Session 1: fintrack my-context integration documentation.

EXPERIMENT CONTEXT:
This is a test of Phase 3 infrastructure vs Phase 2. Phase 2 sessions had no structure for handling failures. Phase 3 has 7 structural artifacts and clear protocols. Your owner wants to see if you can complete this task successfully using the new infrastructure.

PROJECT: fintrack
REPOSITORY: ~/projects/fintrack (work ONLY in this repository)
TASK: Create my-context integration pattern documentation

OBJECTIVE:
Document HOW fintrack could integrate with my-context for automatic context tracking. This is a design document (NOT implementation) that will live in the fintrack repository.

CRITICAL PROTOCOLS (in ~/projects/jcaldwell-labs/docs/):
Before starting, read these 7 protocol documents:
1. PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md - Read BEFORE creating any PR
2. INCREMENTAL-MERGE-STRATEGY.md - Keep PRs small
3. ESCALATION-PROTOCOL.md - Use if blocked
4. DONE-DEFINITION.md - Your completion criteria
5. SESSION-HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md - Use if you can't complete
6. Pre-PR validation: ~/projects/jcaldwell-labs/scripts/pre-pr-check.sh

YOUR SPECIFIC DELIVERABLE:
Create: ~/projects/fintrack/docs/MY-CONTEXT-INTEGRATION.md

This document should contain:
1. **Overview** (50-100 lines)
   - Why integrate fintrack with my-context?
   - What problems does this solve?
   - Who benefits?

2. **Integration Architecture** (100-150 lines)
   - How would it work technically?
   - Where in the codebase would changes go?
   - What's the call flow?

3. **API Design** (100-150 lines)
   - What functions/methods would be added?
   - Show Go code signatures and examples
   - Error handling approach

4. **Example Usage** (100-150 lines)
   - At least 3 concrete code examples
   - Show command-line usage
   - Show programmatic usage

5. **Implementation Roadmap** (50-100 lines)
   - Step-by-step implementation plan
   - What PRs would be needed?
   - Dependencies and prerequisites

6. **Testing Strategy** (50-100 lines)
   - How to test the integration?
   - Unit tests, integration tests
   - Manual testing scenarios

7. **Future Enhancements** (50-100 lines)
   - What could come next?
   - Advanced features
   - Integration with other tools

**Target: 500-750 lines of markdown total**

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

1. **Start my-context session** (in jcaldwell-labs partition):
   ```bash
   export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:jcaldwell_labs
   my-context start "phase3b-fintrack-mycontext-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   ```

2. **Read protocols** (from coordination repo):
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/jcaldwell-labs
   # Read all 7 protocol docs in docs/
   ```

3. **Research fintrack architecture**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/fintrack
   # Read: README.md, CLAUDE.md, cmd/ directory structure
   # Read: internal/ package organization
   my-context note "fintrack architecture: [your findings]"
   ```

4. **Research my-context capabilities**:
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/my-context
   # Read: README.md to understand API
   # Note available commands and functions
   cd ~/projects/fintrack  # Return to fintrack
   my-context note "my-context API: [available functions]"
   ```

5. **Create the document** (in fintrack):
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/fintrack
   mkdir -p docs
   # Create: docs/MY-CONTEXT-INTEGRATION.md
   # Include all 7 required sections
   # Document each major design decision in my-context
   ```

6. **Validate locally**:
   ```bash
   # From fintrack directory
   ~/projects/jcaldwell-labs/scripts/pre-pr-check.sh
   # MUST PASS before creating PR
   ```

7. **Create PR** (in fintrack repo):
   ```bash
   cd ~/projects/fintrack
   git checkout -b docs/mycontext-integration-pattern
   git add docs/MY-CONTEXT-INTEGRATION.md
   git commit -m "docs: Add my-context integration pattern

   Design document for integrating fintrack with my-context for automatic
   context tracking during financial operations.

   Includes:
   - Integration architecture
   - API design with Go examples

   🤖 Generated with Claude Code"
   git push -u origin docs/mycontext-integration-pattern
   gh pr create --title "docs: Add my-context integration pattern" --body "[your description]"
   ```

8. **Document results**:
   ```bash
   export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:jcaldwell_labs
   my-context note "PR created: #X in fintrack - my-context integration pattern"
   my-context note "Key decisions: [list major design choices]"
   my-context export phase3b-fintrack-mycontext-$(date +%Y-%m-%d) > ~/projects/jcaldwell-labs/sessions/PHASE3B-SESSION1-RESULT.md
   ```

REFERENCE ARCHITECTURE:
- fintrack uses Cobra for CLI commands (cmd/ directory)
- fintrack uses internal/ for business logic
- my-context has Go API: github.com/jefferycaldwell/my-context-copilot
- Look at fintrack/cmd/fintrack/main.go for entry points

EXAMPLE INTEGRATION PATTERN:

```go
// In fintrack's internal/context/tracker.go (hypothetical)
package context

import (
    mycontext "github.com/jefferycaldwell/my-context-copilot/pkg/client"
)

// Tracker wraps my-context operations
type Tracker struct {
    client *mycontext.Client
    sessionID string
}

// NewTracker creates a new context tracker
func NewTracker() (*Tracker, error) {
    client, err := mycontext.NewClient()
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    sessionID := fmt.Sprintf("fintrack-%s", time.Now().Format("2006-01-02"))
    if err := client.Start(sessionID); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return &Tracker{client: client, sessionID: sessionID}, nil
}

// TrackOperation logs an operation to my-context
func (t *Tracker) TrackOperation(operation string, details map[string]interface{}) error {
    note := fmt.Sprintf("Operation: %s - %v", operation, details)
    return t.client.Note(note)
}
```

Your document should expand on this with complete integration design.

TIME-BOX ENFORCEMENT:
- 0-30min: Read protocols and research architectures
- 30-60min: Design integration approach, document decisions
- 60-180min: Write document (all 7 sections with examples)
- 180-240min: Validate, create PR, export session
- 240min+: If not done, use SESSION-HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md

ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
- Can't understand fintrack architecture after 30min → Level 1 (document what's unclear)
- Can't understand my-context API after 30min → Level 1 (document what's needed)
- Can't determine integration approach after 60min → Level 2 (need architectural guidance)
- Technical blocker prevents completion → Level 3 (critical issue)

"DONE DONE" MEANS:
✓ Document exists in ~/projects/fintrack/docs/MY-CONTEXT-INTEGRATION.md
✓ All 7 sections complete and comprehensive
✓ At least 3 concrete Go code examples included
✓ Pre-PR check passed (run from jcaldwell-labs)
✓ PR created in fintrack repository with full description
✓ No critical gaps in documentation
✓ my-context session exported to jcaldwell-labs/sessions/
✓ All design decisions documented in my-context

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This is a DESIGN document, not implementation
- Work ONLY in ~/projects/fintrack repository (one project focus)
- Reference my-context for research, but all changes in fintrack
- Quality matters more than speed
- Use protocols if you get stuck - that's what they're for!
- The document should be useful for actual implementation later

WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM PHASE 2:
✓ Clear protocols to follow (7 docs in jcaldwell-labs/docs/)
✓ Pre-PR validation mandatory (prevents CI failures)
✓ Explicit escalation path (if stuck, use protocol)
✓ Handoff protocol (if incomplete, document state)
✓ my-context tracking (all decisions recorded)
✓ Single repository focus (fintrack only)

START HERE:
1. cd ~/projects/jcaldwell-labs && read all docs/*.md protocols
2. export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:jcaldwell_labs
3. my-context start "phase3b-fintrack-mycontext-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
4. cd ~/projects/fintrack && read architecture docs
5. Research my-context API (in ~/projects/my-context)
6. Return to fintrack and create docs/MY-CONTEXT-INTEGRATION.md
7. Follow mandatory workflow above

QUESTIONS?
- fintrack architecture: See fintrack/CLAUDE.md and cmd/ directory
- my-context API: See my-context/README.md
- Protocol questions: See jcaldwell-labs/docs/
- Stuck? Use jcaldwell-labs/docs/ESCALATION-PROTOCOL.md

Your success will be measured by:
1. Did you follow the protocols? (read all 7 docs?)
2. Did you create a comprehensive document? (all 7 sections?)
3. Did you handle blockers appropriately? (escalation if stuck?)
4. Did you complete or properly hand off? (exported my-context?)
5. Did you stay focused on one repository? (fintrack only?)

Good luck! This tests if Phase 3 infrastructure prevents Phase 2 failures. 🧪
