You are working on Phase 3b Session 1 of the jcaldwell-labs organization improvement project.

EXPERIMENT CONTEXT:
This is a test of Phase 3 infrastructure vs Phase 2. Phase 2 sessions had no structure for handling failures. Phase 3 has 7 structural artifacts and clear protocols. Your owner wants to see if you can complete this task successfully using the new infrastructure.

TASK ASSIGNMENT:
Create my-context integration pattern documentation for fintrack project.

OBJECTIVE:
Document HOW fintrack could integrate with my-context for automatic context tracking. This is a design document (NOT implementation), showing other projects the pattern to follow.

CRITICAL PHASE 2 LESSONS - YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE:
1. Use docs/PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md BEFORE creating any PR
2. Run scripts/pre-pr-check.sh BEFORE creating any PR (MANDATORY)
3. Follow docs/INCREMENTAL-MERGE-STRATEGY.md - small PRs only
4. Use docs/ESCALATION-PROTOCOL.md if you get blocked
5. Check docs/DONE-DEFINITION.md for completion criteria
6. Use docs/SESSION-HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md if you can't complete

YOUR SPECIFIC DELIVERABLE:
Create: docs/MY-CONTEXT-INTEGRATION-PATTERN.md

This document should contain:
1. **Overview** - Why integrate fintrack with my-context?
2. **Integration Pattern** - How would it work technically?
3. **API Design** - What functions/commands would be added?
4. **Example Usage** - Show concrete examples
5. **Implementation Steps** - High-level roadmap
6. **Benefits** - What problems does this solve?
7. **Future Enhancements** - What could come next?

SUCCESS CRITERIA (from docs/DONE-DEFINITION.md):
✓ Document created and committed
✓ Document is comprehensive (all 7 sections above)
✓ Examples are concrete and testable
✓ Pre-PR validation passed (scripts/pre-pr-check.sh)
✓ PR created with clear description
✓ CI passing (should auto-pass for docs)
✓ No blockers encountered OR escalation protocol followed
✓ my-context session exported with decisions documented

CONSTRAINTS:
- This is DOCUMENTATION ONLY - no code implementation
- Target length: 150-300 lines of markdown
- Must include at least 3 concrete code examples
- Time budget: 2-3 hours maximum
- If blocked >30min, use ESCALATION-PROTOCOL.md

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:
1. Start my-context session:
   export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:jcaldwell_labs
   my-context start "phase3b-session1-mycontext-pattern-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"

2. Read existing context:
   - Read: ~/projects/fintrack/CLAUDE.md (understand fintrack architecture)
   - Read: ~/projects/my-context/README.md (understand my-context capabilities)
   - Document decision: Why this integration makes sense

3. Create the document:
   - Create: docs/MY-CONTEXT-INTEGRATION-PATTERN.md
   - Include all 7 required sections
   - Add concrete examples with code snippets
   - Document each major decision in my-context

4. Validate locally:
   - Run: scripts/pre-pr-check.sh (MUST PASS)
   - Check: Document is well-formatted markdown
   - Verify: All 7 sections are complete

5. Create PR:
   - Create branch: phase3b/session1-mycontext-pattern
   - Commit with conventional commit format
   - Push and create PR with full description
   - Link to this prompt in PR description

6. Document results:
   - my-context note: "PR created: #X - my-context integration pattern"
   - my-context note: "Key decisions: [list major design choices]"
   - my-context export phase3b-session1-mycontext-pattern-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

REFERENCE MATERIALS:
- fintrack location: ~/projects/fintrack
- my-context location: ~/projects/my-context
- fintrack commands: fintrack --help (or read cmd/ directory)
- my-context commands: my-context --help
- Coordination repo: ~/projects/jcaldwell-labs

ESCALATION TRIGGERS:
- If fintrack architecture is unclear after 30min → Level 1
- If my-context API is unclear after 30min → Level 1
- If you can't determine integration approach → Level 2
- If technical blocker prevents completion → Level 3

EXAMPLE INTEGRATION PATTERN (to guide your thinking):

```go
// Example: fintrack command with automatic context tracking
func ExecuteWithContext(cmd string, args []string) error {
    // Start my-context session
    sessionID := fmt.Sprintf("fintrack-%s-%s", cmd, time.Now().Format("2006-01-02"))
    mycontext.Start(sessionID)

    // Execute command
    result, err := runCommand(cmd, args)

    // Track result
    if err != nil {
        mycontext.Note(fmt.Sprintf("Command %s failed: %v", cmd, err))
    } else {
        mycontext.Note(fmt.Sprintf("Command %s succeeded", cmd))
    }

    return err
}
```

Your document should expand on this pattern with:
- When to start/stop sessions
- What to track automatically
- How to handle errors
- How to query historical context
- How other projects can follow this pattern

TIME-BOX ENFORCEMENT:
- 0-30min: Research fintrack and my-context
- 30-90min: Write document (all 7 sections)
- 90-120min: Validate and create PR
- 120min+: If not done, use SESSION-HANDOFF-PROTOCOL.md

"DONE DONE" MEANS:
✓ Document exists and is comprehensive
✓ Pre-PR check passed
✓ PR created and description complete
✓ No critical gaps in documentation
✓ my-context session exported
✓ All decisions documented

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- This is a DESIGN document, not implementation
- Focus on HOW, not actual code changes
- Other projects will use this as a reference
- Quality matters more than speed
- Use protocols if you get stuck (that's what they're for!)

START HERE:
1. Read this prompt carefully
2. Read all 7 protocol documents in docs/
3. Start my-context session
4. Read fintrack and my-context documentation
5. Create the integration pattern document
6. Follow mandatory workflow above

QUESTIONS?
- Architecture questions: See fintrack/docs/ and my-context/README.md
- Protocol questions: See docs/ in jcaldwell-labs repo
- Stuck? Use docs/ESCALATION-PROTOCOL.md

Remember: Phase 2 failed because of lack of structure. Phase 3 has structure - USE IT!

Your success will be measured by:
1. Did you follow the protocols?
2. Did you create a comprehensive document?
3. Did you handle blockers appropriately?
4. Did you complete or properly hand off?

Good luck! This is a test of the Phase 3 infrastructure. 🧪
