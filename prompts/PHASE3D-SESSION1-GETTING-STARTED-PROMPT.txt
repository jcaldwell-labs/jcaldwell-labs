You are working on Phase 3d Session 1 of the jcaldwell-labs organization improvement project.

CONTEXT:
- Organization: jcaldwell-labs (9 terminal-based open source projects)
- Phase 2: Complete (8/9 repos improved)
- Phase 3a: Complete (unified build system)
- Phase 3b: Complete (integration examples)
- Current Phase: Phase 3d Session 1 - Getting Started + Showcase
- Your Role: Create onboarding documentation and showcase best projects

PHASE 2 LESSONS:
1. Documentation must be tested (not assumed to work)
2. Examples must be executable (copy/paste commands work)
3. Incremental PRs (2 focused PRs, not 1 comprehensive doc)

PROTOCOLS (MUST READ):
All in jcaldwell-labs coordination repo:
1. docs/PR-FAILURE-PROTOCOL.md
2. docs/DONE-DEFINITION.md
3. docs/INCREMENTAL-MERGE-STRATEGY.md

YOUR ASSIGNMENT:
Create getting started guide for new contributors and showcase section for organization profile.

    * Philosophy (Unix terminal tools philosophy)
    * How to choose a project to contribute to
    * Development environment setup
    * Your first contribution (step-by-step)
    * Using the build system
    * Running tests
    * Creating your first PR
    * Getting help
  - Format: Beginner-friendly, tested with real setup
  - Success: Guide is complete, tested with fresh environment
  - Time: ~10h base + buffers = 20h

PR 2: Showcase section (~250 lines)
  - Update: .github/profile/README.md
  - Content:
    * Highlighted projects (choose 3-4 best)
    * Screenshots/demos where applicable
    * Key features per project
    * Links to repos
    * Contribution opportunities
  - Format: Engaging, visual, clear value proposition
  - Success: Organization profile compelling and informative
  - Depends on: PR 1 provides project understanding
  - Time: ~6h base + buffers = 12h

TOTAL: 2 PRs, ~650 lines, ~32h estimated

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

FOR GETTING STARTED GUIDE:
1. **Assume zero knowledge**: Reader may be new to terminal development
2. **Step-by-step**: Every step explicit, no assumptions
3. **Test in fresh environment**: Spin up clean VM/container and follow guide
4. **Include troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions
5. **Show success states**: What does success look like at each step?
6. **Link to examples**: Reference Phase 3b workflow docs

FOR SHOWCASE:
1. **Highlight best projects**: Choose 3-4 flagship projects
   - Suggested: boxes-live (Miro alternative), my-context (production tool), fintrack (full-featured)
2. **Show value clearly**: Why would someone use this?
3. **Visual where possible**: ASCII art, example output, screenshots
4. **Call to action**: How to get started, contribute
5. **Professional tone**: This represents entire organization

MANDATORY WORKFLOW:

For EACH PR:
1. DRAFT: Write documentation
2. TEST: Follow your own guide in fresh environment
3. REVISE: Fix any issues discovered during testing
4. VALIDATE: Ensure all commands work, all links valid
5. CREATE PR: In jcaldwell-labs repo (coordination repo)
6. GET FEEDBACK: Request review from project owner
7. ADDRESS REVIEW: Update based on feedback
8. MERGE: After approval
9. NEXT PR: Move to PR 2

CRITICAL RULES:

1. TEST YOUR DOCS: Follow every step yourself in fresh environment
2. NO BROKEN LINKS: Verify all URLs work
3. NO PLACEHOLDERS: Use real commands and examples
4. BEGINNER-FRIENDLY: Write for someone who's never contributed to open source
5. SEQUENTIAL: PR 2 after PR 1 merged (showcase builds on getting started understanding)
6. TIME-BOX: 38h total budget (32h base + 6h buffer)

"DONE DONE" CRITERIA:

✓ Both docs written and tested
✓ Both PRs merged
✓ Getting started guide validated with fresh environment test
✓ Showcase section published and visible
✓ All links working
✓ Improvement report written
✓ my-context session exported

SUCCESS METRICS:

- 2 PRs created and merged
- Getting started guide tested and working
- Showcase section compelling
- New contributor can follow guide successfully
- Organization profile improved

START HERE:

1. Clone jcaldwell-labs coordination repo
2. Read existing README.md, CLAUDE.md for voice/tone
3. Set up my-context:

   my-context start "phase3d-session1-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
4. Review all 9 project READMEs (understand what each does)
5. Start with PR 1 (getting started guide)

COORDINATION:

You are Session 1 of 2 parallel Phase 3d sessions:
- Session 1 (you): Getting started + showcase (independent)

Work independently. Minimal dependencies.
