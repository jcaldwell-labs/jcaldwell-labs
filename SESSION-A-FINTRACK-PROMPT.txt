# Session A: fintrack Repository Improvement

## Your Assignment

**Repository**: fintrack (Go financial tracking CLI)
**Session ID**: session-A
**Phase**: 2 - Repository Improvements
**Estimated Duration**: 6-8 hours
**Complexity**: High (Go, database, CLI)

## Context

You are working on the jcaldwell-labs organization improvement project. This is one of 7 parallel sessions improving all repositories simultaneously. Your focus is the fintrack repository - a financial tracking and analysis CLI tool written in Go.

## Getting Started

1. **First Actions**:
   - You are already in the fintrack repository
   - Read the coordination roadmap: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs/master/ROADMAP-2025.md
   - Read the parallel session guide: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs/master/PARALLEL-SESSION-GUIDE.md
   - Understand the Phase 2 objectives

2. **Claim Your Repository**:
   - Clone the coordination repo: `git clone https://github.com/jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs.git ~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination`
   - Update `~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination/PARALLEL-SESSION-MANIFEST.md`
   - Change fintrack status from "not_started" to "in_progress"
   - Add your session ID (session-A) and start date
   - Commit and push from coordination repo:
     ```bash
     cd ~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination
     git add PARALLEL-SESSION-MANIFEST.md
     git commit -m "Session A: Claiming fintrack"
     git push
     ```

3. **Start Context Tracking**:
   ```bash
   export MY_CONTEXT_HOME=db:fintrack_improvement
   my-context start "phase2-improvement-$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
   my-context note "Starting Phase 2 improvements for fintrack"
   my-context note "Session ID: session-A"
   ```

## Deliverables

You must produce:

1. **Pull Request** with all improvements
   - Branch name: `improve/phase2-improvements`
   - Title: "Phase 2: Repository improvements for fintrack"
   - Description: Link to improvement report, summarize changes

2. **Improvement Report** (`reports/FINTRACK-IMPROVEMENT-REPORT.md` in coordination repo)
   - Use template from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs/master/templates/IMPROVEMENT-REPORT-TEMPLATE.md
   - Save to: `~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination/reports/FINTRACK-IMPROVEMENT-REPORT.md`
   - Document all checklist items completed
   - Note any items marked as "future work"
   - Include metrics (before/after)
   - List all files modified/added

3. **Manifest Update** (in coordination repo)
   - Update `~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination/PARALLEL-SESSION-MANIFEST.md`
   - Set status to "completed"
   - Add completion date, PR link, report link

4. **Context Export**
   - Export my-context session to `~/jcaldwell-labs-coordination/sessions/session-A-fintrack.md`

## Quality Gates

Before marking complete, verify:

- [ ] All tests passing (`go test ./...`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`go build`)
- [ ] No critical compiler warnings
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR created and ready for review
- [ ] Improvement report written
- [ ] Manifest updated

## Time Management

- **Time Budget**: 6-8 hours
- **Time-Boxing**: If an item takes too long, document it for future work and move on
- **Don't let one item block completion** - note blockers in the report

## Common Go Project Checks

- Run `go mod tidy` to clean dependencies
- Check for outdated dependencies: `go list -u -m all`
- Run `go vet ./...` for potential issues
- Consider running `staticcheck` for deeper analysis
- Check for missing error handling
- Verify panic handling in CLI code

## Important Notes

- **Work independently** - other sessions work on other repos
- **Document blockers** in the improvement report
- **Create issues** for work that can't be completed in time budget
- **Focus on quality, documentation, and testing** - not new features
- **Commit frequently** with clear commit messages

## Communication

- **Updates**: Via PARALLEL-SESSION-MANIFEST.md
- **Blockers**: Note in manifest and improvement report
- **Completion**: Update manifest, create PR, write report
- **Questions**: Create issue in jcaldwell-labs/jcaldwell-labs repo

## Workflow Summary

```
1. Claim repository (update manifest) ✓
2. Start my-context session ✓
3. Work through standard checklist
4. Work through fintrack-specific tasks
5. Run tests and verify build
6. Create PR with improvements
7. Write improvement report
8. Export my-context session
9. Update manifest to "completed"
```

## Ready to Start?

Confirm you understand:
1. Your assignment (fintrack repository)
2. The standard checklist (documentation, code quality, testing, build, CI, project health)
3. The fintrack-specific tasks (transaction management, migrations, CLI docs, config)
4. Your deliverables (PR, report, manifest update, context export)
5. The quality gates (tests pass, build succeeds, docs updated)

Once confirmed, begin by claiming the repository in the manifest.

Good luck! 🚀
